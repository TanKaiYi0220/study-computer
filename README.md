# Process Flow in Development

![](C:\Users\xiaop\Desktop\Self Project\CS README\process_flow.png)

For a big project, we would not work alone for the whole process flow in development so that you may think about which stage is interesting for you. For me, I'm a person who is not interested in marketing and design so that I would not get into **Analysis** and **UI/UX Design** too much. I'm focusing in **Development** stage.

**Strategy** : Discover the issues and evolve your idea to overcome them. *(All person)*

**Analysis** : Consider the availability and demands. *(Manager)*

**Planning** : Define team structure and roadmap for the following development. *(Developer*)

**UI/UX Design** : Design a way for users to understand your project. *(Designer/Developer)*

**Development** : Develop a solution to overcome the issues. *(Developer)*

**Testing** : Validate your project's quality. *(Developer/User)*

**Deployment** : Launch your project as your goal. *(Manager)*
